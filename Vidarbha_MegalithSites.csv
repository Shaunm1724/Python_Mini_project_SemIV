BGN04,Boregaon,StoneCircle,"""Forty-eight stone circles were located with diametersranging between 19.5 and 5.00 m. Five megaliths were excavated which yielded the black andd red ware, black burnished ware and micaceous red ware. Of these, Megalith 36 yielded a few human teeth and iron sickles, chisels and adzes as also a copper dish with a lid having on its knob a peacock motif. Megalith 3 is marked by a huge trough, cut out of a huge boulder, placed right in the centre of the stone-circle. Besides pottery, askeleton of a young horse, human teeth, ear-rings of gold and muller stone were exposed. Megalith 35 yielded a number of iron objects like arrowheads, tridents, legged querns, horse bits, nail parers and axes along with copper bangles, dishes and three hundred etched and non-etched beads of agate and carnelian.",Unknown

BMR02,Bhagimahari,StoneCircle,"more than seventy stone circles; ""three of which were excavated. Their diameter ranged between 9 and 14 m. These circles revealed black and red ware, micaceaous red ware, the black burnished and the painted black on red. Iron objects like axes with cross-ring fastened, knives, daggers, arrowheads and bangles, besides, objects of copper such as bangles and fragments of decorative lid finials as reported from Takalghat and Mahurjhari were noticed. A few fragmentary teeth and bones of horse, as also a few human teeth were recovered from the stone circles. The most noteworthy feature of these stone circles, which was not noticed at any of the sites excavated so far, was the placement in a slanting position within the circle of a huge block of Gondwana formation. The Bhagi mohari stone circlesgave evidence for the first time of stone circles. There were three categories; i. the construction of two square chambers with a common middle wall built of medium sized boulders set in black clay and these boulders were much smaller in size than periphearl boulders of the stone circle. Each chamber was 3 sq. m. A passsage ran east-west; ii. 1 smaller circle at the centre of the stone circle and it was arranged with the help of meddium size boulders set in black clay. The circle had an opening of a little ledd than1m in the southern direction; iii. an irregular circular alignment of medium sized boulders within the stone circle."" In 1982-83 field season ""two circles- onne each in locality V and VI were excavated. The diameters of these ranged between 17.75 and 14 m and one stone of each circle was found to contain cut marks. The one in Loc. V was characterized by a centrally placed huge Gond-wana slab, afeature peculiar to Bhagimahari stone ccircles. These circles yielded iron objects like chisel, nail-parers and axes with cross-ring fasteners, adzes, spearheads, spikes, hoes, ladles with straight handles and beads of carnelian and res jasper. The pottery comprised mostly of the micaceous red ware and the black-and-red, both similar in fabric and typology to those encountered in the habitation. No painted pottery waas found in the burialshere. Another distinctive find was a group of twenty-one copper bangles found around the forearm bone. Not a single skeleton was reported although fragmentary human bones and teeth were recovered, indicating probably partial or secondary burials.  ",Unknown

"" Megalith I consisted of a circle of undressed boulders with an average external diameter of 15m. A couple of circle-stones were, however, missing on the northern side. In the northerrn half of the circle was an irregular shallow pit measuring 8'80 by 3.50m., with the longer axis roughly east-west. On its floor as also in the clay filling above were placed funerary deposits, comprising pottery, iron also in the clay filling above were placed funerary deposits, comprising pottery, iron object and gold ornaments. A stone  pestle along with some iron objects was also found in the rubble packing. Three ancillary pits in the southern half of the circle (marked B, C and D), two f them being very shallow, contained human and human skeletal remains. With the former, which included crushed part of the skull and some long bones, were also found some pots towards the head and forty four carnelian beads, twenty-four of which were etched in white. The latter pit (marked D) commprised bones of Equidae family. Megalith II consisted of a double circle of untrimmed  boulders with an average external diameter of 10.21m. In the north-eastern quadrant was found a crushed pot entombed within the 0.33 high cairn. Apart from this the monument contained nothing. Megalith III consisted of a circle of undressed boulders with an average external diameter of 16 m. A noteworthy feature of the cairn was the occurrence of smaller boulders retaining the rubble packing along the fall of the clay-heap, as also that of the central truncated part, below which funerary objects, like pottery, gold ornaments, a silver stud, copper and iron objects, as also human skeletal remains, were found. Significantly enough, the gold ornaments, consisting of a bangle and a spiral ring, were found along with the latter, the bangle being worn on the radius and ulna, and the ring placed near about jaw-region. The skeletal remians were essentially fragmentary. No special grave-pit was dug into the natural trap-rock."" ",Unknown

KWD04,Khairwada,StoneCircle,"The site has "" about 1400 megalithic stone-circles and habitational deposit strewn over an area of nearly of nearly 13 hectars. The site was noticed in 1869 and a few excavated by Carey, the then Executive Engineer. He reported the find of iron and copper objects and afew human bones. However, there is no mention of habitational deposits."" The excavation carried out in the cementary area was divided into three sectors, viz., 1 to the east of the habitation, 2 in the reserve forest to the north of the habitation and 3 on the other bank of the river Dham and to the south-west of the habitation. The stone-circles were found to have been of two types: 1. those with pebbles and clay falling within a circle of boulders and 2. those with loose pebbles piled up without use of clay within a circle of boulders. In the latter type, the top of the pebble-filling was deliberately depressed. The stone-circles in sectors I and II gave all the ceramic data as in the habitational deposits in layers 7, 6 and 5, besides human teeth, fragmentary long bones, iron axes with cross-ring fastened, iron blades, iron hoes and bird-finials of copper lids, besides teeth and bones of horses. In the stone-circles with pebble and clay filling, there was exposed another smaller circle of boulders in the centre, below which human and horse remains were encountered.  In the megaliths having loose pebbles heaps with a central depression, there was relatively greater occurance of coarse red ware along with micaceous red ware, though the typology of iron and copper artefacts remains unchanged. These seems to indicate a later phase of later burials.""",Unknown
