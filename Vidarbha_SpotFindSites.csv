The inscription, of which only one plate is now known, records the donation of the village of Sriparnaka by Pravarasena II to three beneficiaries: Gangarya, Vasurarya and Rudrrya. The charter was issued to replace an earlier grant of the village Manapallika. (Shastri, p.35).

The donation was made to augment the religious merit of Pravarasena II's mother, Prabhavati Gupta, indicating that she is still alive at the time of issue.

According to Shastri this forgery took place at the time the charter was created and possibly had official 'collusion' in its creation. (Shastri, p.15).

The charter, dating to the 11th year of Pravarasena II reign, records the donation of the village Mahallalata to Suryasvamin.

PSN02,Parshivani,Seal stamp,"This agate seal-stamp (14 mm x 10 mm) was found on a hill near Parseoni (Parshivni) village, approximately 25km north of Nāgpur, in 1940. The stamp is incribed with four characters (aksharas). The legend, written in Sanskrit, reads 'Jitaṁ Bhagavatā', which translates as 'Victory has been attained by the Lord'. This phrase is sometimes found at the beginning of ancient Sanskrit records, but only occurs in one other record from Central India: the Ṛiddhapur plates of the Vākāṭaka queen Prabhāvatīguptā. However, there is no evidence that this seal-stamp was associated with this Vākāṭaka queen. The same legend has also been noted on clay seals from Vaiśālī, where it occurs together with religious symbols and the names of private individuals and trade guilds. This demonstrates that it was a common and auspicious formula.

The characters of the seal-stamp date to the 4th century CE.

TGN02,Teegaon,Inscription (copperplate),"The Tigaon copper plates of Pravarasena II were discovered in this village in 1942 when the house of Kadu Patil was demolished to make way for the Itarsi-Nagpur Central Railway line. Mirashi, (p.63) refers to the plates as the Pandhurna plates even though they were found in the village of Tigaon.

There are five copper plates which record the donation of 2000 nivartanas of land by royal measure in the village of Dhuvavataka (Dhruvavataka) to a number of Br?hma?as. An additional 26 nivartanas in two other villages is recorded in the third plate as being specifically donated to the Brahmana Somarya. Both Mirashi, (p. 64) and Shastri (p. 34-35) argue that this third plate is actually a forgery, inserted into the charter at a later date to benefit Somarya.

The first part of the donation, of the 2000 nivartanas was issued in exchange for the earlier donation by Prthivisena I of the village of Vijayavalli-vataka. The charter was issued in the 29th year of Pravarasena II reign and was issued from the temple of Pravaresvara. (Shastri, pp.32-33).",Vakataka,Epigraphic evidence,No,None,,,,,,,,,,

According to Mirashi the charter was written following the direct order of Pravarasena II. (Mirashi, pp. 48 ? 52)

WSM06,Washim,Inscription (copperplate),"Mirashi refers to these copper plates as the 'Basim' copper plates (p. 93-100) whilst Shastri refers to them as the 'Washim' copper plates (Shastri, p. 37-40).

The four copper plates were discovered by Pandit Vasudev Sastri Dhanagare (Mirashi p. 93) in the town of Washim, which stands on the site of the ancient town of Vatsagulma. The plates are from the Vatsagulma branch of the Vakatakas and were produced for Vindhyasakti II in the 37th year of his reign.

The charter records the donation of the village Akasapadda to fourteen Bramanas by Vindhyasakti II. The charter records the names of the Br?ma?as and the share of the village which they were given. (Shastri,p. 38). According to Shastri the charter is important in that it proves that Pravarasena I, who ruled as part of the undivided family, had at least four sons who all became kings, which until the discovery of this charter had not been satisfactorily proven.

According to Shastri, when compared to other Vakataka inscriptions it is possible to argue that the plates recovered represent the second and last plates of a charter. (Shastri, p. 95) The charter is dated to the 26th year of Pravarasena II reign and records the renewal of a donation of an area of land and two house sites in the village of Latakapalli to Indrarya and Svamideva. That this charter records a renewal of a previously granted donation makes the Yavatmal copper plates very unusual in the corpus of known Vakataka inscriptions. The inscription was written by Bappadeva, who is also mentioned in the Siwani and Wadgaon Vakataka inscriptions. (Shastri, pp. 95-96)",Vakataka,Epigraphic evidence,No,None,,,,,,,,,,
